  This program is made for partial hessian calculation.
  hessian-read.f90 will read mass-wighted hessian from
molpro-format-frequencies.out, you need to change mass-wighted line to ####
for convenience.
  hessian.f90 will calculate the partial hessian whose matrix element is
selected in select.dat, and then we will diagonalize it by jacobi method.
  Be careful of mass in select.dat and selected number in hessian.dat
